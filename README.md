# Pokémon Zippy Crystal

This is a fork of [Pokémon Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal).

Some of the changes include:

## New Starter:

**Partner Pikachu**
(Increased BST, exclusive ability, exclusive tutor moves.)

## New Abilities:

**Partner Bond**
(Friendship battle mechanics.)

**Liquid Voice**
(Sound based moves become Water-type and receive a small boost.)

**Electric Surge**
(Summons a thunderstorm on entry.)

**Surge Surfer**
(Doubles Speed stat in a thunderstorm.)

**Comatose**
(User is permanently asleep. Can still attack. Immune to non volatile status conditions.)

## New Weather:

**Thunderstorm**
(Electric attacks have their power increased by 50%. Thunder has perfect accuracy. Enables some of the new abilities.)

## New Moves:

**Zippy Zap**
(Priority Electric attack that is always a critical hit.)

**Splashy Surf**
(Strong Water attack that has the chance to paralyze the foe.)

**Floaty Fall**
(Strong Flying attack that has the chance to flinch the foe.)

**Pika Papow**
(Electric attack that never misses.  Power is based on friendship.)

The above four are exclusive to Partner Pikachu; You can find the new tutor NPC in the pokemon centers of Goldenrod, Ecruteak and Cianwood. 

**Rising Volt**
(Electric attack that does double damage if used in a thunderstorm.)

## New Gift Pokemon:

**Bulbasaur**

**Charmander**

**Squirtle**

All 3 of the Kanto starters will be available earlier than normal through NPCs. Look for them in Ilex Forest, Ecruteak Shrine and Olivine docks. 

## Changes to existing Pokemon:

**Raichu:**
Had its BST increased slightly. New hidden ability, Electric Surge.

**Alolan Raichu:**
New regular ability, Surge Surfer. 

**Lapras:**
New hidden ability, Liquid Voice. 
Shell Smash is now included in the Move Reminder's list. 

**Snorlax:**
New hidden ability, Comatose. 

**Removed moves:**
Icicle Crash, Octazooka, Crabhammer, Zap Cannon, Bonemerang, Hi Jump Kick.

## Known Issues:
Thunderstorm weather is currently lacking unique graphics and animation.
Thunderstorm move has not been distributed yet. 

Some of the new dialog presumes you picked Pikachu as your starter and have them in your party. This may be revised in the future if more starters are added. 

Affection Bonus in the game settings does nothing, regardless of whether you enable or disable it. This is by design.
