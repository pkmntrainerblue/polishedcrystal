# Pokémon Zippy Crystal

This is a fork of [Pokémon Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal).

Some of the changes include:

## New Starters:

**Partner Pikachu**
(Increased BST, exclusive ability, exclusive tutor moves.)

## New Abilities:

**Partner Bond**
(Friendship battle mechanics.)

**Liquid Voice**
(Sound based moves become Water-type.)

**Transistor**
(Powers up Electric type moves by a great deal.)

**Surge Surfer**
(Doubles Speed stat in rain.)

**Comatose**
(User is permanently asleep. Can attack. Immune to non volatile status conditions.)

## New Tutor Moves:

**Zippy Zap**
(Priority Electric attack that is always a critical hit.)

**Splashy Surf**
(Strong Water attack that has the chance to paralyze the foe.)

**Floaty Fall**
(Strong Flying attack that has the chance to flinch the foe.)

**Pika Papow**
(Electric attack that never misses.  Power is based on friendship.)

Exclusive to Partner Pikachu; You can find the new tutor NPC in the pokemon centers of Goldenrod, Ecruteak and Cianwood. 

## New Gift Pokemon:

**Bulbasaur**

**Charmander**

**Squirtle**

**Munchlax**

All of them will be available earlier than normal through NPCs. Look for them in Ilex Forest, Goldenrod Department Store, Ecruteak Shrine and Olivine docks. 

## Changes to existing Pokemon:

**Raichu:**
Had its BST increased slightly.
Type changed to Electric/Normal. New hidden ability, Transistor.

**Alolan Raichu:**
New regular ability, Surge Surfer. 

**Lapras:**
New hidden ability, Liquid Voice. 
Shell Smash is now included in the Move Reminder's list. 

**Snorlax:**
New hidden ability, Comatose. 

**Removed moves:**
Icicle Crash, Octazooka, Crabhammer, Zap Cannon. 

## Known Issues:
The Zap Cannon tutor now teaches Zippy Zap instead. This is a placeholder until a new move has been implemented. 

Some of the new dialog presumes you picked Pikachu as your starter and have them in your party. This may be revised in the future if more starters are added. 

Affection Bonus in the game settings does nothing, regardless of whether you enable or disable it. This is by design.
